# Electronic_receipt_analyzer
App that analyses e-receipt from auchan and biedronka in Poland

Currently only handling auchan receipts.

To run the app, you need to add your receipt to the "data" folder. An example receipt is included in this folder with the format "\<year>-\<month>-\<day>.jpg".

Then, run the program using Python with the following command:
>python3 main.py

Once the program is running:

1. Enter the file name in the first text input field.
2. Click the "Load File" button.
3. Click the "Reload Database" button. If any part of the receipt isn't recognized, a popup will appear for assigning the category.
4. Save the result to an Excel file.
